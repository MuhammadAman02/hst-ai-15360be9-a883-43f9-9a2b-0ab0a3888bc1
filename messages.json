The main heading \"Hello World!\" will be in blue, and the subheading \"Welcome to my first web page!\" will be in green. The page is centered both vertically and horizontally.\n</HST-code>\n\nThe page has been created to match the image, with a blue \"Hello World!\" heading and a green welcome message."
